Write a program to create a class Employee with data members name, code and
basic pay and with functions to initialize and print information. Create an
interface Salary with a function salary calculation. By inheriting the Employee
class and Salary Interface create a new class SalarySlip which overrides the
salary calculation method to calculate the net salary of an employee from basic
pay. Provide a function to print the Salary Slip of the employee in the
SalarySlip class.
