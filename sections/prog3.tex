Create a package called pack which contains a class Prime with a member
function checkPrime() to check whether a number is prime or not. Create another
package called mypack containing a class Matrix with the member functions to:
read a matrix, display the matrix, find the sum of diagonal elements of the
matrix and check whether the sum is prime or not by accessing the method
checkPrime() from Prime class.

\subsection{Code}
Prime.java (package pack)
\inputminted[frame=lines, breaklines, breakanywhere, numberblanklines=false]{java}{./programs/prog3/pack/Prime.java}
Matrix.java (package mypack)
\inputminted[frame=lines, breaklines, breakanywhere, numberblanklines=false]{java}{./programs/prog3/mypack/Matrix.java}

\subsection{Output}
Enter 9 matrix elements \\
1 2 3 \\
0 1 0 \\
0 1 2 \\
Given Matrix: \\
1 2 3 \\
0 1 0 \\
0 1 2 \\
\\
Diagonal is prime \\
